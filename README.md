1. QC_raw_data.qmd - quality control steps of the raw embryonic data
2. QC_filtered_and_preprocessing.qmd - quality control steps of the visually filtered embryonic data
3. clustering_optimization.qmd - different clustering approaches and their evaluation
4. marker_gene_analysis.qmd - extraction of marker genes based on previously identified clusters
5. nmf_and_enrichment_analysis.qmd - non-negative matrix factorization & functional enrichment analysis of factors to identify transcriptional programs
6. chromatic_tda.py - chromatic topological data analysis to identify topological features at the neural tube-somite-notochord interface
